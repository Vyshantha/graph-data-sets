    - glyph-set-id

        For the scripts or numeral systems of a script or font variety (or varieties) of a script or cipher script or notation systems the identifier ISO 15924 - Code Number will be used for those in Unicode 16.0.

        For the glyph (inclusive of grapheme) set yet to be included in Unicode (or non-ISO), the convention is by assigning *(unique 4 letter code of Exonym-Name)-998 as the complete identifier for those sets that have the Unicode L2 proposal or *(unique4 letter code of Exonym-Name)-999 as the complete identifier for those sets with no Unicode L2 proposal.
